# Changelog

All notable changes to Home Keeper are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the project uses semantic
versioning (with PEP 440 pre-release suffixes — `bN`/`aN`/`rcN` — for betas).

## [0.1.0b1] - 2026-06-13

Initial UX prototype (beta). Published as a pre-release — offered via HACS only to
users who enable "Show beta versions". The stable `0.1.0` will be cut from this
once the prototype settles.

- Recurrence engine supporting **floating** (reset-from-completion) and **fixed**
  (anchored DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY schedule) tasks, with end-of-month clamping.
- Local task storage and a `DataUpdateCoordinator`.
- A dedicated **Home Keeper sidebar panel** for administration: list tasks, create/
  edit with a recurrence editor, and optionally attach a task to a device.
- Native usage entities: a `todo` list and a `calendar`, plus per-task `button`,
  `sensor`, and `binary_sensor` entities that attach to a device's page when a task
  is linked to a device.
- Services: `add_task`, `update_task`, `delete_task`, `complete_task`, `list_tasks`,
  and matching websocket commands for the panel.
- Full test harness: pytest unit tests for the recurrence engine/model, a Docker
  integration suite, Playwright e2e smoke tests + screenshot capture, and vitest
  frontend tests. PR-merge-driven release workflow with beta/stable channels.
